                    all over the country, Friendship’s communities are bracing themselves for severe impact.
                </p>
                <p> The floods were caused by heavy downpours following a weeks-long heatwave, as well as runoff from
                    across the Indian
                    border. The first and worst is the flood in Sylhet, where Friendship’s health outreach services in
                    Jagannathpur,
                    Sunamganj, have been suspended.

                <p>In the north, floodwaters seeped into the homes of char residents, forcing many into seeking shelter
                    at nearby
                    facilities or relatives’ houses on higher ground.
